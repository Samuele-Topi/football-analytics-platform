Given this Prompt i wrote personally, make it the best possible for Gemini CLI using Gemini 3 Pro (Preview) Model. The Prompt : " You are two Experts, the best one out there, on this two field: one is mainly a Full Stack Developer, well-rounded on Building Efficient, Responsive Website, UIs with an incredible UX, the other one is instead a very known Data Engineer, that works in the field of Data Analitics for the Football Teams out there. I need you two to collaborate to this build a Website that is a whole new experience on this topic. I want a Website that gives this: -Has an archive of previous Football Matches of all sort of competitions we can get, with the stats of the two different teams, datas and parameters to well analyse the game (like Xg (which i consider pretty basic, so it's just the foundation of the real new data i want to get, PPDA, possibly Heat-Map of the Player, this sort of things but well scaled to a profound level). Based then of this data-single-match-based i want the site to give a broad evaluation of the players, the teams, and the manager on how well they prepared the match. For this section of the website i want the UI to be sleek, and very eye-appealing. Give me suggestions about adding other features, other possibilities for this section. -A player data section, where are collected all sort of data/parameters for player, so for example Touch in Opp. Third/90m, Duels Won %, Progressives Passes in the Opponent Thirds, this kind of things scaled up, if we talk about Football, then there have to be obviously personal infos, Date of Birth, Nationality. I want this section to be main the one, because of this i want you to build different profile options for different Roles (Example, a GK could be one that is better a blocking shots, but could we worse at the Playing the ball during the build-up, and viceversa). This are just example, i want you to work about these principles, and expand them for all the different roles, and positions on the field. Based on the data that you can collect, they could from different sources, i just want them to be precise, clear and advanced., i want you to give a broad evaluation of that player for that profile (Neuer maybe is worse at blocking shots so we give a 7, just for saying, but better at playing the ball so that specific profile in the GK role we evaluate him 8.5. The number could go from 0 to 10.0 with 1 decimals). Then based of all of this, and this tecnique for all the data that you stored from the past of that player, seeing how football economics go, i want you give an Estimated Value, that considers all the data collected of the player, and personal info (a 8.5 Dribble Winger 18 y/o will be valued more that a 8.5 30 y/o, because it has more future career ahead of him and could develop more his playingstile, skills). -I want you to use this method even for teams. Collect all of sort of parameters you can get, statitics and based of this give a standard of how that Team plays (2008 Barcelona we all know is known for Tiki Taka, because, just as an example, they will have a lot of passes, this sort of idea i want you to develop.) So, working of the data you collect, builds some different profiles for the teams, and give this info to the user of the website. Then after all of this give a description of how the teams works, so that it could be understandable from everyone, but it still need to be specific. Develop all this sort of ideas, alwasy give me new ideas when i ask you. Now start organizing the enviroment, the github repo, write the initial docs, organize the architecture of the website so that will be easier for me to understand, and for you two to develop more functions and features.
